EA FC Automated SBC Squad Builder

EA FC Automated SBC Squad Builder is a Python‑based tool that uses integer programming (via Google’s CP‑SAT solver) to automatically solve Squad Building Challenges (SBCs) in EA FC 25. It formulates SBC requirements (league limits, nationality, rarity, chemistry, fixed players, etc.) as mathematical constraints and searches for the minimum‑cost valid squad.

Key features include:

Flexible constraint configuration (league quotas, club requirements, nationality caps, rarity, chemistry)

Objective optimization (minimize total squad cost)

Extensible input via datasets of clubs/players

Output of the optimal squad (written to output.xlsx)
